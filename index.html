							On this little homepage I'll post some experiences I make in programming, mainly in <b>AutoHotkey</b> and <b>C#</b>.
						</p>
						<h3 class="sub-header" id="history">my short coding history</h3>
						<p class="paragraph">
							I started programming in late 2010, with the great <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com">AutoHotkey</a> scripting language.
							I did not use it a lot for hotkeys and automation, its typical uses.
							Instead I was more interested in developing libraries, mostly using some Windows API.
							Starting with "regular" functions, like the <a href="http://de.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8274">DWM thumbnail API</a>,
							I moved on to the fantastic and various topics of <b>COM</b>. <br />
							Thanks to Steve Gray / Lexikos and his AutoHotkey_L custom build, there's already a great integration of <b>COM</b>:
							using script objects, scripters can call any <code>IDispatch</code> interface.
							However, there's more than just <code>IDispatch</code>:
							After investigating a bit, and with great help from Lexikos and other community members,
							I got around how to call those interfaces' methods. This is when the <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=71201">COM Classes Project</a> was born.
						</p>
						<p class="paragraph">
							Following the <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic54494-480.html">IronAHK</a> project and some of its contributors in the forums,
							namely IsNull and RaptorOne, I got in touch with <b>C#</b>.
							Curious as I am (sometimes ;-), I started looking into it. The online book <a href="http://www.guidetocsharp.de">guide to Csharp</a> lead me into the right direction.
							As I like learning by doing, I started by translating my current <b>AutoHotkey</b> project, called "AHK.ScriptsMan", into <b>C#</b>.
							This thing has developed a lot since that time, it's still my main project,
							but now it is called <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=72874">ChameleonCoder</a>.
