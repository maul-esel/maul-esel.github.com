							On this little homepage I'll post some experiences I make in programming, mainly in <b>AutoHotkey</b> and <b>C#</b>.
						</p>
						<h2 class='sub-header' id='history'>my short coding history</h2>
						<p class='paragraph'>
							I started programming in late 2010, with the great <a href='http://www.autohotkey.com'>AutoHotkey</a> scripting language.
							I did not use it a lot for hotkeys and automation, its typical uses.
							Instead I was more interested in developing libraries, mostly using some Windows API.
							Starting with &quot;regular&quot; functions, like the <a href='http://de.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8274'>DWM thumbnail API</a>,
							I moved on to the fantastic and various topics of <b>COM</b>. <br />
							Thanks to Steve Gray / Lexikos and his AutoHotkey_L custom build, there's already a great integration of <b>COM</b>:
							using script objects, scripters can call any <code>IDispatch</code> interface.
							However, there's more than just <code>IDispatch</code>:
							After investigating a bit, and with great help from Lexikos and other community members,
							I got around how to call those interfaces' methods. This is when the <a href='http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=71201'>COM Classes Project</a> was born.
						</p>
						<p class='paragraph'>
							Following the <a href='http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic54494-480.html'>IronAHK</a> project and some of its contributors in the forums,
							namely IsNull and RaptorOne, I got in touch with <b>C#</b>.
							Curious as I am (sometimes ;-), I started looking into it. The online book <a href='http://www.guidetocsharp.de'>guide to Csharp</a> lead me into the right direction.
							As I like learning by doing, I started by translating my current <b>AutoHotkey</b> project,
							called <a href='https://github.com/maul-esel/AHK.ScriptsMan'>&quot;AHK.ScriptsMan&quot;</a>, into <b>C#</b>.
							This thing has developed a lot since that time, it's still my main project,
							but now it is called <a href='http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=72874'>ChameleonCoder</a>.
